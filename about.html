                    My name is Roman Kriuchkov ‚Äî a backend developer with a strong academic foundation 
                    and a drive to build reliable, scalable systems. I began my journey in Ukraine, studying 
                    Software Engineering at KPI (Kyiv Polytechnic Institute), and now continue my path at 
                    Queen‚Äôs University Belfast, expanding my expertise in the international environment.

                    <p>
                    My core stack revolves around <strong>Java, C/C++, and Python</strong>. Over the past few years, I‚Äôve developed projects ranging 
                    from bots to full-stack applications and database-driven systems. Currently, I‚Äôm building a 
                    <strong>CRM platform</strong> as a portfolio project ‚Äî combining technical depth with practical business value.

                    <p>
                    What drives me most is solving challenging problems, designing clean architectures, and pushing 
                    technology to deliver performance and reliability at scale.

                <p>
                I was born and raised in Ukraine, and my journey in tech has been shaped by 
                resilience, adaptability, and a strong desire to build a future abroad. 
                Thanks to the <em>Homes for Ukraine</em> sponsorship program, I am now pursuing 
                my academic and career goals in the UK. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Outside of programming, I am deeply passionate about sports, music, travel, 
                and hands-on creativity. Here are some of the things that keep me motivated 
                and inspired:
